<h1>Managing a Git-submodule tree</h1>

<p>All of my source code lives in a tree of Git submodules, extending downwards from my &#39;master&#39; source repository, which is simply named <code>robin</code>. This giant tree of code includes everything i have ever written - both practice code and project code.</p>

<p>The reasons that i keep up this practice are described in this post: <a href="http://mrrobinsmith.com/blogposts/blah">Living in the cloud</a></p>

<p>I recently became frustrated with the command <code>git submodule foreach --recursive</code>, which allows one to execute a given shell command for each submodule, recursing down the submodule tree. My frustration was with the inability to recurse <em>upwards</em> using this command. The reason i wanted this functionality was so that i could save all of my code changes using a single command, adding committing and pushing changes in each repo, from the lowest submodule to the topmost parent. I had devised a system for the repositories that i commonly used, which involved creating a <code>submodules.csv</code> file in each of these directories. It was simple to use some Ruby code inside of a Rake task to parse these files, but in the end i never ended up using the &#39;save all&#39; functionality - it just wasn&#39;t practical, and my <code>submodules.csv</code> files quickly became neglected.</p>

<p>Whilst doing a fresh clone of my code on another laptop, i decided that i wanted to be able to do <code>git checkout master</code> on each cloned repository directly after cloning, since on a few occasions i ended up making, committing and pushing changes on a <code>detached</code> commit from the previous recursive clone. However this checkout ended up leaving a &#39;dirty-commit&#39; message when running <code>git status</code> in parent repositories. I had some idea of resolving this which again required an upwards recurse up my repository tree.</p>

<p>Finally i more recently got to wondering &#39;just how many submodules do i have in my tree?&#39; And &#39;what would this tree look like?&#39; - if i were to make a graphical representation of it. I realised that i simply wanted the power to perform any arbitrarily-complex action for each submodule, whether or not i was recursing upwards or downwards. Since i am also currently enjoying learning the Ruby language, i finally found a justification for writing my own <code>.gitconfig</code>-style parser, in order to parse the <code>.gitmodules</code> files which are necessarily maintained in a perfect state of correctness. Once this was complete, i could work on code for manipulating those submodules and <code>.gitconfig</code> files. It was a fun project for a Sunday-afternoon, followed by minor tweaks and a few feature additions over the next week. It was highly enjoyable as i wanted to apply my test-driven-development technique in Ruby. The result was that i was able to come up with what i believe to be a nice, simple interface for <code>.gitconfig</code>-file manipulations, backed-up by robust, well-tested code.</p>

<h2>What it looks like</h2>

<h3><code>rake each_sub[&#39;echo, quiet&#39;]</code></h3>

<p>The &#39;drawing&#39; of my code tree is simply a special case usage of my <code>rake each_sub</code> command, where i am just running the shell command <code>echo</code>, with my rake task in <code>quiet</code> mode - which suppresses terminal output from the command.</p>

<h3><code>rake sort_sub</code></h3>

<p><screenshot showing sorted .gitmodules file>
<img src="/images/rake_sort_sub.png" alt="Screenshot showing drawn code tree" /></p>

<p>Using my code library, it was exceedingly simple to add a <code>sort!</code> method to my <code>GitConfigFile</code> model, which delegates to a <code>GitConfigBlockCollection</code> class to perform the sort.</p>

<h2>The code</h2>

<p>Below is a list of classes that i used to implement this functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>GitConfigBlock</code> - represents a single section of <code>.gitconfig</code> file</li>
<li> <code>GitConfigBlockCollection</code> - stores a list of <code>GitConfigBlock</code> instances and provides collection-manipulation methods like <code>sort!</code>, which sorts the collection alphabetically by name, where <code>name</code> would be <code>ruby</code> in the following .gitmodules block:
<code>[submodule &quot;ruby&quot;]
path = ruby
url = git@bitbucket.org:robinrob/ruby.git
branch = master</code></li>
<li> <code>GitConfigFile</code> -</li>
</ul>
