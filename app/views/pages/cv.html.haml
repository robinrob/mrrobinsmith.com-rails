                        Software Developer - Cloudreach Ltd. (October 2011 – June 2013)
                    .cv-experience-content
                        I joined Cloudreach as the first developer in their new Edinburgh office. I immediately became
                        and remain a core developer on Cloudreach's first sellable product: Alumina Connect - a
                        substantial application which runs on the Salesforce Force.com platform and synchronises data
                        with Google Apps. I quickly got up to speed with the Force.com platform and was able to
                        apply my self-taught programming skills to immediately contribute to the project.
                        I wrote and maintained a tool using Bash and Ant to automate deployment of code from online
                        source code repositories to the Force.com platform. The tool was used by fellow developers
                        and later by members of other teams for deployments to customer production environments.
                        I took onboard a Python/Javascript web app project when the core developer left the company.
                        I was brought up to speed within just a few days and was able to implement the remaining
                        features and fix existing bugs, whilst still learning Python and Javascript.

                    .cv-experience-content
                        An opportunity arose to change role to DevOps engineer. I have gained practical knowledge of
                        the AWS platform, Splunk, Google Apps and many tools for diagnosing issues with Cloud
                        technologies. I have vastly improved my ability to communicate with customers.

                        I take a very energetic and positive approach to life and try to make the most of every day.
                        Handling the workload of my degree alongside paid employment and recreational activities
                        taught me effective planning, organisation and working to a self-disciplined schedule. I apply
                        this philosophy to every working day which starts with a kilometer of swimming.

                .cv-experience-content
                    I'm very physically active and swim and cycle every day. I love playing pool with friends,
                    making new ones and meeting random people. I highly value downtime to myself to play guitar
                    or piano, play games, read books, or cook fine food. I am also a keen astronomer. I recently
                    attended and highly enjoyed the developer conference 'Whisky Web 2' in Scotland, where I was
                    lucky enough to stay in Airth Castle: http://whiskyweb.co.uk/
