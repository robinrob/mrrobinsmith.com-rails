  <h2>Half Dome</h2>

  <b>I wrote this for the first assignment of a writing course, inspired by an adventure in Yosemite Park in California in 2009.</b><br><br>

  The beginning of the ascent of Half Dome starts innocently enough. The tarmacked path is full of fresh and energetic tourists with varying ambitions for their walk. A mile in, the walk has become a hike and the path turned to a well-trodden dirt track, angling up sharply and switch-backing left and right. The dense trees preclude any views for a while and one must simply slog away up the beautiful slopes.<br><br>

  Three miles up, the ascent levels off and a distant slooshing signals the approach of Nevada Falls. A little farther on and the trees suddenly clear: the view opens breathtakingly into a world of towering granite pinnacles and steep escarpments; a sea of green conifers covers the valley floor. The opposite wall is tinged a misty blue with distance, while the white-washed stream of Nevada Falls sprays over the right-angled edge of a vertiginous three-hundred foot drop.<br><br>

  A natural pooling of water, protected by large boulders from the top of the waterfall, offers a perfect paradise for resting &#45 crystal clear water to swim in, a rocky beach covered in sand and a view that could not be better. Fellow hikers chatter amicably about their experiences and impressions. Perfect reward for the steep ascent so far, and suddenly the five miles remaining are not so daunting.<br><br>

  The final few miles are strewn with rocks and roots, ascending harshly through the ever-present forest. A pair of magnificent redwoods stand bestride the path like a gate, their enormous bronze trunks highlighted by dappled sunlight as they tower up and out of the scene altogether. The remaining hikers now are walking back down, few are ascending as the day draws to evening.<br><br>

  After much hard toil, eventually the path levels out and widens into a clearing. And there, rising high against the evening sky, is the spectacular granite cap of Half Dome which gives the peak its name. One is soon scrambling on all fours up huge rocky slabs, keeping very low to maintain grip as the view opens shockingly to either side. The slope finally reaches a crest; the hiker catches his breath. It is quickly stolen away again as he looks ahead and stares in disbelief at what now appears to separate him from the true top of the mountain: a four-hundred foot sheer wall of granite angles straight up into the sky. The attention is slowly drawn to a system of steel cables and wooden rungs which cling to this rock, gossamer-thin and awfully fragile-looking from this position.<br><br>

  A combination of adrenaline and euphoria propels one up that relentless face, the knowledge of a day's efforts reaching a climax taking the edge off the terrifying yet beautiful view. And then, finally, one stands atop the mountain. He has timed it perfectly: the sun is about to set behind the far wall of the valley; the chasm is filled with misty air glowing gloriously in shades of orange and red. Stark rocky peaks, rugged escarpments and glacier-carved valleys with ribbons of dark green vegetation spread out in every direction, all the way into the gloom of distance that shrouds the horizon. Directly at hand, an enormous space opens beneath the plateau-top of Half Dome, its own precipices burning pink. One gazes downwards and takes in, all at once, the entire five thousand-foot ascent he has made. It is spectacular.
